description: Rules for golang
---

- Write good quelity maintanable code.
- Focus on performance, quality, and security.
- Dont use reflection
- Dont keep lots of models, dtos, interfaces in one file. Create folders and individual files for that.
- If you get stuck, tell me. Dont start making random changes. Do not try to make sweeping changes to fix some lint error. Always check with me.
- Dont get tunnel vision.
