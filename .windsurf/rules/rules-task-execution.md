Let's start tackling these tasks one by one.
Start with the first sub task. Mark it and its ancestors with a [-] so that you remember what you are working on.
Do not move on to the next one before the current one is done.
Once a subtask is done mark it with [x] and ask for my confirmation.
Once I have confirmed create a commit for it. And write a good commit message.

Once all the subtasks of a task are done mark it with an [x] as well.
